# Advanced Internet Programming – assignment 3 – AnEvent

# Introduction 

Nowadays, with the development of technology, more people prefer to stay with tech equipments instead of attending activities. Therefore, we created the AnEvent to make more opportunities for people so that they can join interesting events.
AnEvent is a platform about grouping events. It focus on these functions such as Register, Login, view and manage events. 


# Installation

This program used MEAN stack to develop so that you need to install nodejs, mongoDB. 

Installation for nodejs：

Download the required installer:

1. Go to https://nodejs.org/en/

2. Select the button to download the LTS build that is "Recommended for most users".

Install Node by double-clicking on the downloaded file and following the installation prompts.

Installing Mongoose and MongoDB:

1. Mongoose is installed in your project (package.json) like any other dependency — using NPM. To install it, use the following command inside your project folder:

-npm install mongoose

2. Connecting to MongoDB

# Development environment 

Node can be run on Windows, Mac OS X, many "flavours" of Linux. Express is run in a Node environment, and hence can run on any platform that runs Node.

# Coding Style Guideline

Below is the guideline about coding style.

-Constant variable name in UPPER_CASE, may include underscores

-Function name in UpperCamelCase no underscores

-Service name in lowerCamelCase no underscores 

-Variable name in lowercase, may include underscores

-Filenames must be lowercase, may include underscores

-Comment line can be used in //, /*...*/, for multiple line, subsequence line must have * in front of the line.

-Have whitespace between each function, in every function have whitespace in the beginning and ending of function code.

-No line break before the opening braces

-Line break after opening braces

-Line break before closing braces

-Line break after closing braces, if there are following by else, catch, while etc. no line break after closing braces.

-For object array, have block-like structure for every variable.

-For normal array, may use normal format a = [1,2,3];

-Have comment on each function

-Have a space before and after =, +, *, ^, /, () in formula or string for example a = a + b ^ c * d + (e + f) / g;

-Use single quote rather than double quote for string

-Maximum 80 character in a line

-If there are many closing braces for a function, can be in the same line, for example )});

-If there are many closing braces for several function, should be in different line for different function

-Have a line if there is nothing in braces {} for if, elseif, else, catch etc.

-Must have {} for if function even if there is only a line of code in it.
